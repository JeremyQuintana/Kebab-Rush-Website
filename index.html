                <td>Short story: Yes. Long Story: Did Software development aswell as Systems Engineering for VCE giving programming and web design experience. Additionally did VisCom for VCE giving me overall design experience. BTW never do those three subjects together for VCE since theyre all pretty much practical, work heavy subjects. You will die from lack of sleep. Legit collapsed standing up one time.</td>

                <td>Short story: Why not? Impulsive decision I guess. Long story: Was tossing up whether to go to an engineering, design or I.T. course after VCE. At the very last day to submit VTAC preferences I thought why not. Since I was traumitised the least by I.T. in VCE I should be fine.</td>

                <td>What partner? (cry inside) jks. Give me the formatting and design work, since I like designing stuff. But I'm, still cool with the overall programming. And I don't know what I want my partner to have. Do their share of the work I guess? TBH I hate research if we need to do that.</td>
